Parchis Game
=============

This Project is a type of Parchis game in which there are two players. Both of them have turns, and throw the dices and select their movement. When they move
the idea is to get to the end of the board. However, if the other player goes to the same position where the other player is, the player that was in that position initially
is going to return to the start of the board.

It is a project done with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. 

It was a project for a class. However, I feel that was fun.
