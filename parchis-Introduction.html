                <li>Every player is going to have a turn.</li>
                <li>When a player initiates its turn, the player will throw two dices.</li>
                <li>The player can choose between moving the added result of the dices or<br>
                    move one of the results of one of the two dices.
                </li>
                <li>If the player moves to a tile where the other player is, the other player <br> will move back to the start.</li>
                <li>The player that gets to the finish line, wins!</li>
                <li>The user has to get the exact number to get into the end tile. If the player selects <br>
                    a move that is greater to the end, then the player will not move, and it will lose the turn.</li>
